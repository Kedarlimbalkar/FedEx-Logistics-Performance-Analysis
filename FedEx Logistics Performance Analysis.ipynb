        ". Delivery Timeliness and Performance\n",
        "A central theme was the analysis of delivery timelines. By creating a new feature representing the difference between the Scheduled Delivery Date and the Delivered to Client Date, we can measure on-time delivery performance. Visualizations such as bar charts and histograms reveal the distribution of delivery delays and lead times. This analysis will identify which Shipment Mode (e.g., Air vs. Truck) or Country has the most significant delays. These findings can point to specific logistical bottlenecks that need to be addressed to improve delivery timelines and meet customer expectations more consistently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cost-Effectiveness and Vendor Performance\n",
        "To evaluate cost-effectiveness, the analysis delved into the relationship between Line Item Value, Pack Price, and Freight Cost (USD). By calculating cost per unit and cost per shipment, we can compare the financial performance of different Vendor INCO Terms and Manufacturing Sites. This could reveal if certain vendors consistently incur higher freight costs or if specific Incoterms lead to more economical shipments. For instance, a scatter plot of Line Item Value versus Freight Cost could help identify a correlation or reveal outliers that warrant further investigation, providing a clear path for cost reduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Identifying Bottlenecks and Operational Inefficiencies\n",
        "The EDA also looked for patterns in shipment data that might indicate systemic issues. By aggregating data by Product Group and Country, we can create heatmaps to visualize high-traffic areas or regions with frequent delays. For example, a bar chart could compare the average delay time across different Manufacturing Site locations, flagging underperforming suppliers. The analysis of PQ First Sent to Client Date and PO Sent to Vendor Date can also shed light on internal processing delays. These insights are crucial for streamlining workflows, optimizing vendor relationships, and ultimately reducing operational friction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
        "The EDA on FedEx Logistics data provides a robust overview of the supply chain, moving beyond a simple spreadsheet view to a dynamic understanding of operational performance. The insights gained from this analysis, ranging from on-time delivery metrics to cost-per-shipment breakdowns, provide a clear roadmap for strategic decision-making. By leveraging these findings, FedEx Logistics can:\n",

In a competitive market defined by the rise of e-commerce and global distribution, optimizing these operations is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge.\n",

        "The core business problem is to leverage a comprehensive dataset of logistics information—including purchase orders, shipment methods, vendor terms, and delivery schedules—to identify and address key operational challenges. We need to analyze this data to pinpoint bottlenecks, evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different shipment methods, and assess delivery timelines. The objective is to move beyond reactive problem-solving by providing a data-driven framework to streamline the supply chain, thereby reducing freight costs, improving delivery speed, and enhancing the overall customer experience. This project will deliver actionable insights that allow FedEx to proactively optimize its logistics and solidify its market leadership."

Similarly, all date-related columns are strings and need to be converted to a proper datetime format. Several columns, including Shipment Mode and Dosage, also have missing values that must be handled.
